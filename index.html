        <p>On a quiet evening at 221B Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes was lounging on his chair, sipping his tea, when suddenly, a mysterious letter arrived. The letter had no return address, just a cryptic message:</p>

        <p><b>"Dear Sherlock, I challenge you to prove your worth. If you are truly the great detective you claim to be, you will solve this challenge. If not, well, let's just say you'll never hear from me again. Good luck, my friend."</b></p>

        <p>Sherlock raised an eyebrow, intrigued but unfazed. "Another challenge? How delightful!" he muttered to himself, tossing the letter aside. Little did he know, this one would be different.</p>

        <p>As Sherlock opened the next page, he found an odd request:<b>"Find the magical number, Sherlock. The number that has a hidden property only the sharpest minds can find. The number that holds the key to the next stage of this mystery. But beware, it is not as simple as it seems."</b></p>

        <p>Not one to back down from a challenge, Sherlock quickly scanned the instructions. It was a test of logic, observation, and wit. "Ah, a number puzzle. How quaint," Sherlock thought, cracking his knuckles. "I do love a good puzzle!"</p>

        <p>But just as he was about to dive in, the letter revealed a catch.<b> "The numbers you need to analyze are not just any numbers. They have a secret property, one that only the truly observant can detect. You must find how many of them has their sum of digits divisible by 5... "</b></p>

        <p><b>An example for you:</b></p>
        <div class="test-case">
            15, 25, 123, 505, 432, 678, 910, 111, 34, 76
        </div>

        <p><b>Answer for it: 2</b></p>

        <p><b>Examine closely to go to next step, Sherlock...</b></p>
